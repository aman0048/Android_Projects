# Android_Projects
This is basically a single screen app where we have learned how to insert an image and text over it. 
Here we have learned about relative layout and different types of views like ImageView and TextView.
Here we have created a drawable folder for storing our image and used those images by referring to the drawable folder
Whenever you do Android .... always write a name in camelcase like amanGargIs (every staring alphabet after first alphabet should be capital)
